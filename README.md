# rePatch reLoaded:

### Modification of rePatch that adds Homebrew app0: and ux0:/data migration to other partitions, allowing you to play games with data on different storage.


### ioplus may be required


This plugin serves as a substitute for the patch folder when an existing update is present on official cartridges or other encrypted formats. It also has the benefit of loading decrypted content on 3.60+.

**To clarify: this plugin works on 3.60-3.68 on NoNpDrm, official cartridges, and officially downloaded games.**

Note: Be wary of using a Vitamin dumped(or similar) eboot, it will be affected by save issues.
